This repository serves as a collection of my daily Codewars kata solutions in Java.

Each solution is on its own branch.

Most solutions will have the "best practice" (as rated by majority of users) solution commented at the bottom.

These are only accessible after completing the kata, therefore, my solutions may not be as efficient.. and that's okay!

Happy learning :)
